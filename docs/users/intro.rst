What is EELSLab
---------------

EELSLab is a `scientific` hyperspectra data analysis software. It was started in 
the domain of Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), but it is useful for any 
other spectroscopy domain.

Why is it different?
--------------------

EELSLab has been written by the scientists that use it in their daily research, 
a particularity that sets its character. Scientist do indeed write a lot of 
code, but (with remarkable exceptions) many times they are in the form of 
scripts that, once they do their job (normally producing some publishable 
results) are rarely distributed. Therefore, reinventing the wheel is 
commonplace in casual scientific programming.

When writing EELSLab we wanted to provide a framework for hyperspectral data 
analysis that makes it easy for scientists to add their contributions. 
In other words, the code must be as simple and feel as natural as possible.
With this view we have chosen to write it in Python, a high level programming 
language with very high quality scientific libraries. When coding, every 
increase in complexity must provide a clear benefit.
