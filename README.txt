Hyperspy is an open source library providing tools for interactive data
analysis of multidimensional datasets. It is specially well-suited for
spectroscopy data analysis.

Main features:
* Data structures to easily operate on multidimensional datasets with
  integrated indexing and iterators.
* Visualization of n-dimensional spectra and images. 
* Curve fitting.
* Machine learning e.g. PCA, ICA...
* Reading and writing of multidimensional datasets in multiple file formats.

Hyperspy is released under the GPL v3 license.
