﻿Getting started
===============

This 5-step guide is intended to give people who want to start contributing
to HyperSpy a foothold to kick-start the process. This is
also the way to start if you ultimately hope to become a member of the
developer team.

We anticipate that many potential contributors and developers will be
scientists who may have a lot to offer in terms of expert knowledge but may
have little experience when it comes to working on a reasonably large
open-source project like HyperSpy. This guide is aimed at you - helping to
reduce the barrier to make a contribution.


1. Start using HyperSpy and understand it
-----------------------------------------

Probably you would not be interested in contributing to HyperSpy if you were not
already an user, but, just in case: the best way to start understanding how
HyperSpy works and to build a broad overview of the code as it stands is to
use it -- so what are you waiting for? `Install HyperSpy
<http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/install.html>`_.

The user-guide also provides a good overview of all the parts of the code that
are currently implemented as well as much information about how everything
works -- so read it well:
`HyperSpy User-Guide <http://www.hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index
.html>`_.


2. Got a problem? -- ask!
-------------------------

Open source projects are all about community - we put in much effort to make
good tools available to all and most people are happy to help others start out.
Everyone had to start at some point and the philosophy of these projects
centres around the fact that we can do better by working together.

Much of the conversation happens in 'public' via online platforms. The main two
forums used by HyperSpy developers are:

`Gitter <https://gitter.im/hyperspy/hyperspy>`_ -- where we host a live
chat-room in which people can ask questions and discuss things in a relatively
informal way.

`Github <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues>`_ -- the main repository
for the source code also enables issues to be raised in a way that means
they're logged until dealt with. This is also a good place to make a proposal
for some new feature or tool that you want to work on.


3. Pick your battles
--------------------

There are many ways to contribute to HyperSpy:

1. Just by asking any question you may have in our
   `Gitter chat room <https://gitter.im/hyperspy/hyperspy>`_
   instead of sending a private email to the developers you are contributing to
   HyperSpy.
2. Issues reported in the
   `issues tracker <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues>`_
   are precious contributions.
3. The documentation (let it be the docstrings, guides or the website)
   is always in need of some care. Beside, contributing to HyperSpy's
   documentation is a very good way to get familiar with GitHub.
4. `Pull requests <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/pulls>`_ reviews are
   essential for the sustainability of any open development software project
   and HyperSpy is no exception. Therefore, reviews are highly appreciated.
   While you may need a good familiarity with
   the HyperSpy code base to review pull
   requests containing new features, you can start by reviewing
   simpler ones such as documentation contributions or simple bug fixes.

If you are planning to contribute code, work out what you want to contribute
and break it down in to manageable chunks.

You may have a very clear idea of what you want to contribute but if you're
not sure where to start you can always look through the issues and pull
requests on the `GitHub Page <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/>`_.
You'll find that there are many known areas for development in the issues
and a number of pull-requests are part finished projects just sitting there
waiting for a keen new contributor to come and learn by finishing.

When you've decided what you're going to work on - let people know using the
online forums!

It may be that someone else is doing something similar and can help, it's also
good to make sure that those working on related projects are pulling in the
same direction.

4. Get good habits
------------------

There are 3 key points to get right when starting out as a contributor

1. use Git branches to keep work separated in manageable sections
2. make sure that your code style is good, and
3. bear in mind that every new function you write will need a test
   and user documentation!

5. Make your contribution
-------------------------

When you've got a branch that's ready to be incorporated in to the main code of
HyperSpy -- make a pull request on GitHub and wait for it to be reviewed and
discussed.
