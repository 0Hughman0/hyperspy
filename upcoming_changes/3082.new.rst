Add support for using tabulated datasets of *generalised oscillator strengths* using the GOSH
open file format. GOS are a key component in modelling EELS core loss spectra.

A freely usable dataset can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/record/6599071 .
The path to the downloaded file can be specified by setting :meth:`preferences.EELS.eels_gosh_database_path`,
or by calling :meth:`preferences.gui()`

The new GOS can then be loaded by specifying :meth:`GOS='gosh'` when calling :meth:`create_model()`.

More information at :ref:`eels.fitting` and the documentation to
:py:meth:`~._signals.eels.EELSSpectrum.create_model`
