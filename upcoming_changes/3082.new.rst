Add support for using tabulated generalised oscillator strengths using the GOSH
open file format to model EELS spectra.

The new GOS can be loaded by specifying `GOS='gosh'` when calling `create_model()`.

A freely usable dataset can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/record/6599071 .
The path to the downloaded file can be specified by setting `preferences.EELS.eels_gosh_database_path`,
or by calling `preferences.gui()`
