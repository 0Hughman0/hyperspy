Documentation fixes:

- Fix cross-references in documentation and enable sphinx "nitpicky" when building documentation to check for broken links.
- Fix using mutable objects as default argument.
- Set some :class:`~.component.Component` attribute as properties to add to the API reference with their docstrings.
