Documentation fixes:

- Fix cross-references in documentation and enable sphinx "nitpicky" when building documentation to check for broken links.
- Fix using mutable objects as default argument.
- Change some :class:`~.component.Component` attributes to properties in order to include their docstrings in the API reference.
