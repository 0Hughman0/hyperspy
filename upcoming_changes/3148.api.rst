The markers have been refactored - see the new :py:mod:`~.api.plot.markers` API and the :ref:`gallery of examples <gallery.markers>` for usage. The new :py:class:`~.api.plot.markers.Markers` uses :py:class:`matplotlib.collections.Collection`, is faster and more generic than the previous implementation and also supports lazy markers. Markers saved in HyperSpy files (``hspy``, ``zspy``) with HyperSpy < 2.0 are converted automatically when loading the file.
